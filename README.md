# CS-Revision-App
This is an app That I hope to build for the school just to make it much easier to access revsions sources because a huge csv file for of resources isnt the best way or 
cleanist way.

To run the app clone the repository on up in your IDE of choice and then run index.html on local host. I suggest if you are using VS code to use live server for an easy way
to try out the app
